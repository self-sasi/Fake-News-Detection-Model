# Fake News Prediction Model

## About Files in the Repository

### `Dependencies.py`
- Contains all the necessary imports for the project.

### `Preprocess.py`
- Handles preprocessing of data including:
  - Data munging
  - Removal of stopwords
  - Stemming of text to its base form
  - Factorizing using TfidfVectorizer
  - Splitting data into 80:20 ratio for training and testing
  - Fitting the training data into a logistic regression model from scikit-learn

### `Evaluate.py`
- Runs the model and tests its accuracy over training and testing data.

### `Predict.py`
- Uses the trained model to make predictions.
- Contains the `predict_news()` function responsible for making predictions.

### `app.py`
- Contains the code for the frontend, utilizing Flask to create a user interface.
- Calls `Predict.predict_news()` to make predictions and display output.
- Contains a string variable `HTML_TEMPLATE` for the structure of the web page.

### `structure.html`
- Contains HTML and CSS code for the `HTML_TEMPLATE` in `app.py`.
- Serves no direct functionality; created for testing the web page's appearance.

### `train.csv`
- Contains over 20,000 entries used for training and testing the model.

### `test.csv`
- Sample file with multiple entries of news for testing purposes, not used in training.

### `LICENSE`

## How to Run the Model on Your Local Computer

### 1) Cloning the Repository:

The initial step involves cloning the repository into a local directory on your machine. To accomplish this, execute the following command in your command prompt or Git Bash:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/self-sasi/Fake-News-Detection-Model.git
```

### 2) Installing Necessary Tools:

Ensure that Python is installed on your system. Then install the following libraries using the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn
```

After installing the main packages, you may need to download specific resources from NLTK:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

### 3) Ensuring File Organization:

Make sure every single file is saved in the same directory to avoid file-not-found errors.

### 4) Running the Application:

Execute the `app.py` file by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

This should open a web page in your preferred browser. Once loaded, you can directly use the tool for prediction.

### Note:

The running of `app.py` can take time as a huge dataset is used for training. Once the model is formed and displayed completely on the webpage, it should be quick in processing.

## Screenshots and Model Insights

This section provides a visual and statistical representation of the project, including the performance of the prediction model, user interface, and other relevant details.

### User Interface
